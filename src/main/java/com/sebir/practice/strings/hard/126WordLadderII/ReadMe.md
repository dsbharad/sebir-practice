# 126. Word Ladder II

URL: https://leetcode.com/problems/word-ladder-ii/description/?envType=problem-list-v2&envId=string

A transformation sequence from word beginWord to word endWord using a dictionary wordList is a sequence of words beginWord -> s<sub>1</sub> -> s<sub>2</sub> -> ... -> s<sub>k</sub> ->  ... -> s<sub>k</sub> such that:

Every adjacent pair of words differs by a single letter.
Every s<sub>i</sub> for 1 <= i <= k is in wordList. Note that beginWord does not need to be in wordList.
s<sub>k</sub> == endWord

_<u>Problem statement</u>_: Given two words, beginWord and endWord, and a dictionary wordList, return all the shortest transformation sequences from beginWord to endWord, or an empty list if no such sequence exists. Each sequence should be returned as a list of the words [beginWord, s<sub>1</sub>, s<sub>2</sub>, ..., s<sub>k</sub>].

 
**Example 1:**

    Input: beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]
    Output: [["hit","hot","dot","dog","cog"],["hit","hot","lot","log","cog"]]
    Explanation: There are 2 shortest transformation sequences:
    "hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> "cog"
    "hit" -> "hot" -> "lot" -> "log" -> "cog"

**Example 2:**

    Input: beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]
    Output: []
    Explanation: The endWord "cog" is not in wordList, therefore there is no valid transformation sequence.

 
**Constraints:**

	1.  1 <= beginWord.length <= 5
	2.  endWord.length == beginWord.length
	3.  1 <= wordList.length <= 500
	4.  wordList[i].length == beginWord.length
	5.  beginWord, endWord, and wordList[i] consist of lowercase English letters.
	6.  beginWord != endWord
	7.  All the words in wordList are unique.
	8.  The sum of all shortest transformation sequences does not exceed 105.
